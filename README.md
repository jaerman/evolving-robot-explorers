#Evolving Robot Explorers
### Project based on K≈çan 11 of the [shanghAI Lectures](http://shanghailectures.org)

This student project is a thought experiment within the scope of the ShangAI Lectures.
It focuses on the benefit and application of embodied artificial intelligence and evolutionary algorithms.
The experiment revolves around an unmanned mission to a celestial body to search for evidence of extra-terrestrial life. Due to the distance to promissing candidates real-time control is impossible. Furthermore, there exists limited information about those candidates: under surface conditions, exact material composition and on-site structure. Hence, this project focuses on the requirements and challenges an autonomous (multi-)robot system may face, tries to evaluate reasonable options and eventually propose an approach.
