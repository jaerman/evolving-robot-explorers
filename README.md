#Evolving Robot Explorers
### Project based on K≈çan 11 of the [shanghAI Lectures](http://shanghailectures.org)

This student project is a thought experiment within the scope of the ShangAI Lectures.  
We are an international team with a shared passion for artificial intellifence, robotics and of course space.  
Studying the field of **embodied artificial intelligence**, our project focuses its benefits and its symbiosis with **evolutionary algorithms**.  
The experiment revolves around an unmanned mission to a celestial body to search for evidence of **extra-terrestrial life**. Due to the distance to promissing candidates real-time control is impossible. Furthermore, there exists limited information about those candidates: under surface conditions, exact material composition and on-site structure. Hence, this project focuses on the requirements and challenges an **autonomous (multi-)robot system** may face, tries to evaluate reasonable options and eventually propose an approach.
